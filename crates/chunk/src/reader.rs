//! Reads for an owner on a runtime task (docs/design/node.md §1.3, chunk-store.md §7): each read
//! handed to the device's issuer as one batch and taken once its answer comes, verified exactly as
//! [`Volume::read`] verifies one, so the owner's thread never waits on the device. A storage node
//! serves its chunks' reads this way from the shard that also runs its transport, where a read
//! that waited would hold every connection the shard carries.
//!
//! A [`Reader`] holds its reads to the volume's measured [`Reads`], as the volume's gate holds
//! reads made on threads: at most `depth` at the device and their buffers within `bytes` (or one
//! read alone), `waiting` more kept in the order they came and sent as turns come back, and any
//! past them refused with `Busy`, before anything is taken for them, so the caller reads another
//! copy.
