//! A branch (docs/design/engine-structure.md §4, step E3): an immutable B-tree of store pages
//! packed in one pass from entries in ascending key order, as SplinterDB packs a memtable or a
//! compaction's output (research/34 §1). Its index entries carry their subtree's entry count, so
//! a range's size is known without reading its leaves.
//!
//! A page's payload, little-endian:
//!
//! | Bytes | Field |
//! |---|---|
//! | 0 | kind: 1 leaf, 2 index |
//! | 1..3 | entries, `n` |
//! | 3..5 | the prefix every key of the page shares, its length `p` |
//! | 5..5+p | the prefix |
//! | then `2n` | each entry's offset in the payload, in key order |
//! | then `4n` | each entry's head: its suffix's first 4 bytes, big-endian, zero-padded |
//! | then | the entries |
//!
//! A leaf entry is the key's suffix length (2 bytes), the operation (1), the value's length (2),
//! the suffix and the value. An index entry is the suffix length (2), the child's page (8), the
//! entries under the child (8) and the suffix of the child's first key. The prefix is the longest
//! one the page's first and last keys share, which, the keys being sorted, every key between them
//! shares: object-store keys are paths, and their shared prefixes are most of each key.
//!
//! A search runs over the heads, two cache lines for a page's entries, and reads an entry only
//! where its head ties the key's: the entries themselves lie across the page, a cache miss each,
//! as the memtable's nodes keep heads past their prefixes (memtable/btree.rs).
