//! The engine's typed errors, which replace RocksDB's `Status` codes (docs/research/24 §2.3).
//!
//! RocksDB reports a bad decode as `Status::Corruption`, a `false` return or a null pointer,
//! and a refused format as `Status::NotSupported`; its decoders also trust some inputs and
//! read past them (docs/research/24 §5 R6). Here each of those is a variant a caller can match.
