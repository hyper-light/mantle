//! The trie of a Fast Succinct Trie in LOUDS-DS (Zhang et al. SIGMOD 2018 §2.2–§2.4;
//! research/35): its upper levels in LOUDS-Dense, a node as a 256-bit bitmap of its labels and
//! one of the labels whose branch goes on, so a child is found by one bit test and one rank; its
//! lower levels in LOUDS-Sparse, a node's labels as bytes with a bit a label for whether its branch
//! goes on and a bit for whether it is the node's first. The levels are cut where the dense part
//! would pass 1/64 of the sparse part (the paper's R = 64).
//!
//! Where the paper marks a node whose path is itself a key with a 0xFF label (sparse) or a bit in
//! a third bitmap (dense), a bit a node marks it here at every level: a bit where the label took
//! eight, and no rule needed to tell it from a real 0xFF byte.
//!
//! The dense part's nodes are numbered breadth first, the root 0; the branch that goes on at a
//! label leads to node `1 + (branches going on before it)`, or, past the dense nodes, to a node of
//! the first sparse level. The sparse part is kept a level at a time, as the builder lays it out:
//! the nodes of a level are the branches going on in the level above, in order, so the branch at
//! label `p` leads to the next level's node `rank1(has_child, p) − 1`, and rank runs within a
//! level. Where the paper finds a node's first label by select on S-LOUDS, each node's start is
//! kept (`Starts`). The trie is finished without the paper's assembly of the levels into one
//! sequence (one pass over every label, milliseconds at half a million keys, in one slice): each
//! level's words are copied whole and indexed. Values are held a level at a time in node order: a
//! node's own key's value, then its labels' that end a key.
