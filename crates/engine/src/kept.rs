//! One index over the memtables a shard keeps readable for gets (research/51 §7): each key's
//! newest entry among the memtables it covers, by the key's 64-bit filter hash
//! ([`crate::branch::filter::hash`]), as the memtable's number and the entry's arena offset.
//!
//! A packing worker walks each key's newest entry of a memtable's copy as it builds the branch,
//! and hands back the (hash, offset) pairs ([`KeyList`]); a maintenance worker adds the lists of
//! the memtables kept since to an index it was handed ([`KeptIndex::extend`]), the newer
//! memtable's entry replacing an older one's, and hands it back; the shard only probes it. A
//! probe's answer is the shard's to check: the memtable still kept, and its key at that offset
//! the one asked. Two keys of one hash share an entry, the newer memtable's: a get of the other
//! finds a key that is not its own, a miss, and reads the trunk, which holds every kept
//! memtable's records.
//!
//! Memtables are numbered by a counter that wraps: the memtables an index covers and the shard
//! keeps span far fewer than 2^31 numbers, so "older" is decided modulo 2^32 ([`older`]).
