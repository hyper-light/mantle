//! A shard's memtable (docs/design/engine-structure.md §8, step E3), keeping order only when
//! order is asked for.
//!
//! Every entry is appended to one byte arena (operation, key length, value length, key, value),
//! as the B-tree memtable kept them, and a hash index maps each key's hash to its newest entry:
//! an insert is an append and an index write, and a get one index lookup. Nothing is sorted as
//! entries arrive (RocksDB's vector memtable defers its sort the same way; FloDB, Balmau et al.,
//! EuroSys '17, puts a hash table in front of its ordered memtable for the same reason).
//!
//! Order is kept in sorted runs. The entries appended since the last sort began form the tail.
//! The memtable's owner starts a sort of the tail as the memtable fills ([`HashMem::start_sort`],
//! paid a bounded slice at a time through [`HashMem::debt`] and [`HashMem::pay`]), so a full
//! memtable is nearly in order when it is packed; [`HashMem::seal`] sorts the tail at once when a
//! scan needs it. Runs are merged within a level, as the logarithmic method of Bentley and Saxe
//! ("Decomposable searching problems I: static-to-dynamic transformation", J. Algorithms 1(4),
//! 1980) merges them, de-amortized as Overmars and van Leeuwen spread its rebuilds, so a walk
//! merges logarithmically many (research/40).
//!
//! Runs hold each entry's offset beside eight bytes of its key (AlphaSort's key-prefix sort:
//! Nyberg, Barclay, Cvetanovic, Gray and Lomet, "AlphaSort: A RISC Machine Sort", SIGMOD 1994):
//! two entries whose prefixes differ are ordered without reading the arena, so a sort, merge,
//! seek or walk reads runs in sequence and an entry's arena bytes only to hand it out. The eight
//! bytes start past the prefix every key in the memtable shares with its first key, so keys under
//! one common prefix (a range's keys) still differ in them. A tail is sorted by its prefixes with
//! a least-significant-digit radix sort, a byte a pass, skipping bytes with one value.
//!
//! A key written again leaves its older entry in the arena and in whatever run holds it; the
//! arena is only appended to, so a larger offset is a newer entry, and merges and walks keep the
//! newest of equal keys.
