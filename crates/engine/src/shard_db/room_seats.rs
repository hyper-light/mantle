//! Who gets a seat when a growth due ahead of need and a packing held for a seat both want one
//! ([`ShardDb::grow`]), on an engine prepared as a range's is, whose owner steps a test's task
//! takes one at a time, on a store grown by segments, its pool's two seats on a test's relays
//! ([`relay`]). Each step is answered with what the owner left: whether a packing is held for a
//! seat, a growth is out or due, what waits for room, and the seats free.
//!
//! The independent holder is the test's own job, an index of nothing sent to the pool and held
//! on its seat: no owner of the engine waits on it. Facts decide every verdict: the relays name
//! each job and result as it passes, and each step's answer what the owner left. Each wait for a
//! fact has a failure guard ([`WAIT`]) a passing run never reaches.
