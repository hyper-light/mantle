//! The store's page cache (docs/design/engine-structure.md §5, step E8): verified node pages'
//! payloads kept in memory, so a point read that hits costs no I/O. With uncached I/O the device
//! serves every read the cache does not, as SplinterDB's own cache does (research/34 §1).
//!
//! Eviction is S3-FIFO (Yang et al., "FIFO queues are all you need for cache eviction", SOSP
//! 2023): a small FIFO that new pages enter, a main FIFO, and a ghost FIFO of addresses recently
//! evicted from the small one. A page read twice while in the small queue moves to main; one
//! evicted from it is remembered in the ghost, and enters main directly if read again; a page
//! leaving main with reads left goes round again with one read fewer. The parameters are the
//! reference implementation's (libCacheSim `S3FIFO.c`: small queue 10% of the cache, ghost 90%,
//! promotion at two reads, a page's count capped at 3).
//!
//! Pages lie in chunks of memory. A new chunk has room for as many pages as all before it together
//! (a table that doubles, CLRS §17.4), so a cache that grows to `n` pages allocates O(log n)
//! times; it holds at most one tuning step of the limit (`TUNE_STEP_PERCENT`, Luo and Carey, PVLDB
//! 2021 §5.4), so a step that lowers the limit gives back whole chunks, and at most what the limit
//! has left. A chunk's pages become slots in idle time (`reserve`), each written once as it is
//! made, as many as the reads since the last such time asked for; a read that finds none makes
//! its own (`make_now`), and leaves its page out only at the limit or while a chunk retires. The
//! cache takes the memory its reads use, not its limit (measured: reserving up to a 32 GiB limit
//! as reads came made 7.74 allocations and 31.7 KB of allocation a get over a 10M-key store, and
//! more than halved its gets; research/50 §9). Resizing sets the page limit;
//! a cache above it is brought down a few pages an operation (`trim`) by the rule above, and the
//! chunks above it are given back the last first, its pages dropped. A freed slot is the next
//! page's, so a warm cache allocates nothing. The index and the ghost grow a few buckets a write
//! (`util::incmap`), so no read rehashes them.
//!
//! The ghost names the addresses evicted within the last `ghost_cap` evictions. A ghost hit
//! leaves a hole rather than keeping an older address longer, as libCacheSim's ghost FIFO does,
//! so the ghost may name fewer: what keeps it a map with no queue to compact.
//!
//! Every queue and map is bounded by the cache's page count. A page written at an address is
//! dropped from the cache (`forget`), so an address reused after its extent is freed never reads
//! the page it held before.
