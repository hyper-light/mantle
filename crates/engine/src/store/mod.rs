//! The engine's own file (docs/design/engine-structure.md §3, §7; step E1): checksummed pages in
//! extents, a reference-counted allocator persisted with each checkpoint, and two alternating
//! superblock copies naming checkpoints whole.
//!
//! A checkpoint is made in the order §7 gives:
//! 1. the structure's new pages are written (by the caller, [`Store::write_page`]);
//! 2. the allocator map is written, copy-on-write, to extents of its own;
//! 3. the platform's full flush;
//! 4. the superblock copy for the new generation, naming the root, the map and the applied index;
//! 5. the full flush;
//! 6. the extents no longer named are freed for reuse.
//!
//! So the newest superblock copy that verifies always names a checkpoint whose every page is
//! durable, and recovery ([`Store::open`]) takes it. A write or flush that fails leaves the
//! durability of what was written unknown (hyper-block's `BlockFile::sync_data`): the store then
//! takes no more writes, and the caller reopens it from the file.
