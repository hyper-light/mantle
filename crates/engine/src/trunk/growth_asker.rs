//! A worker whose job outgrew its grant waits for extents the shard's admitted extents cannot
//! give, holding its seat. With every seat so held and no growth out, the file's growth goes to the
//! oldest waiting asker as its reply ([`Pool::send_growth`]): it adds and writes the segment whole,
//! reports it, and takes its extents once the segment is admitted. On a real segmented file, with
//! the one worker a pool of one has, a merge whose interleaved entries pack one a page where its
//! inputs packed one or two outgrows the grant of all its inputs' extents:
//! - its output reads back exactly, the newer input's values and tombstones over the older's, and
//!   every extent granted or topped up is the output's or comes back unused, each once;
//! - a segment booked before the ask and smaller than it is grown and admitted first, and the ask,
//!   still short, is handed a second growth, each reported;
//! - a growth whose write fails comes back as that failure, which stays the pool's first error
//!   through the close, whether the close began before the report or after;
//! - a growth whose write unwinds comes back failed when its asker's job ends, the unwind first;
//! - a close that begins while the asker's growth write is held completes only after that write.
//!
//! Facts decide every verdict: the gate counts growth writes begun and finished, the runtime task
//! reports what it saw, and each wait for a fact has a failure guard ([`WAIT`]) a passing run never
//! reaches.
