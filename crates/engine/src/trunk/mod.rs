//! The trunk (docs/design/engine-structure.md §4, step E4): SplinterDB's size-tiered Bε-tree over
//! branches (research/34 §1), one shard's, so one worker runs it and no lock is taken.
//!
//! - A **node** has pivots, each a lower bound of the keys under it, with a child (none at a
//!   leaf) and a **pivot bundle** of branches, newest first; and **in-flight bundles** the node
//!   received, shared by its pivots, each pivot reading those from its own start on.
//! - A packed memtable waits as **pending**, read before the tree, until it enters the root's
//!   in-flight list (**incorporation**), which waits only while the root itself is changing.
//! - Maintenance is flat per-node tasks (CLAUDE.md §10; [`upkeep`]): each node's triggers plan
//!   its pivots' compactions, flush its full pivot bundles and take the change it wants, and one
//!   pass with a counted budget ([`Trunk::step`]) runs them, a compaction merging a budget of keys
//!   a step and changing its node only once it is done. Every change applies on the shard's
//!   thread between steps, so every read between steps sees the trunk whole.
//! - **Compaction**: a pivot with in-flight bundles merges them, clipped to its range, into one
//!   branch at the front of its pivot bundle; each entry is rewritten once a level.
//! - **Flush**: a pivot bundle of more than `fanout` branches moves to the child as in-flight
//!   bundles by reference, no entry rewritten (flush-then-compact). A node over `fanout` pivots
//!   splits.
//! - A **leaf** whose bundle passes `fanout` branches is compacted whole, tombstones dropped (no
//!   older entry lies below it), and split by entries once past `leaf_entries`.
//! - A **point read** goes root to leaf: each node's pivot for the key, its live in-flight
//!   bundles newest first, then its pivot bundle; each branch's filter is asked before its leaf
//!   is read.
//!
//! References: a branch is named by one node at a time (a flush moves a bundle, it never copies
//! one) and holds the one reference its extents were allocated with; the node that drops it
//! releases them, so an extent is freed exactly when no node names it.
