//! Maintenance workers: a shard's packing of full memtables and its trunk's compactions run on
//! threads of their own, so the shard's thread keeps taking puts while they run, as RocksDB's
//! flushes and compactions run on background threads beside its writers
//! (`max_background_jobs`; SILK, Balmau et al., USENIX ATC 2019, schedules them so). A job is a
//! compaction's inputs and range, or a full memtable's entries to pack; a worker runs it on its
//! own store over its own handle on the shard's file ([`Store::worker`]), writing into extents the
//! shard granted it, and hands back the branches made, named by the ticket the job's send
//! returned ([`Ticket`]): a worker freed while its result waits for its owner can take that
//! owner's next job, so the worker alone does not say which job a result answers. Nothing is
//! shared between threads: the shard keeps its memtables and trunk, a job owns its inputs'
//! descriptors, and a packing owns the copy of its memtable's arena, which the worker sorts
//! itself and gives back with the result for reuse ([`SortPack`]; research/40 §4). The trunk and the memtables change only on the shard's thread, when a
//! result is taken, so a read between never sees one half changed.
//!
//! How many workers: Little's law, L = λW (Little, Operations Research 9(3), 1961). Between one
//! period's start and the next (the trunk starts one when its root takes pending branches or a
//! consolidation starts), the shard's thread offers maintenance its memtables at the pace
//! puts fill them, and the workers spent `busy` nanoseconds on jobs; the shard itself ran for
//! `period` nanoseconds of that, its waits on the workers left out, since those measure too few
//! workers rather than demand. Keeping up takes `busy / period` workers on average, so the pool
//! admits the ceiling of that measured ratio as active jobs, at least one and at most the cores the OS reports
//! less the shard's own (`std::thread::available_parallelism`). A worker is started only when a
//! job is ready and none is free, so a pool never holds more threads than jobs were ever out at
//! once. Idle seats keep their warm stores and reservations until terminal retirement, so
//! reducing demand cannot overlap an old store's destruction with a replacement in its seat.
