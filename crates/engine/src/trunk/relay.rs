//! A test's relays on a pool's seats, for module-local tests of what the shard does with its
//! workers. Each seat's jobs pass a relay thread on their way to its worker, and the worker's
//! messages another on their way to the shard. The relays name what passes, by seat and kind, in
//! the order it passed, and hold what they are armed to hold:
//! - the next job of a kind: its seat is then held by it, the worker not yet given it;
//! - the next result of a kind: its worker is done with it, the shard not yet told.
//!
//! A hold lasts until it is released or the relays are opened, which [`OpenOnDrop`] does, so a
//! failed assertion leaves no worker and no shard waiting on a relay. Each wait for a fact has a
//! failure guard ([`WAIT`]) a passing run never reaches.
