//! The positional file operations the log and the chunk store are written against, so a test can
//! put a simulated device with power-loss semantics (`crate::sim`) where the real file goes.
//!
//! A file has one owner at a time: the thread that issues its I/O. The trait asks `Send` and not
//! `Sync`, so a file moves to its owner and is never shared; a second thread that needs the same
//! file gets a second handle of its own ([`BlockFile::try_clone`]), as the issuer's workers do.
