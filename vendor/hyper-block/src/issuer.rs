//! One issuer per physical device: every volume on the device hands it its writes and flushes,
//! and it keeps the device's depth in flight on a fixed set of workers (mantle
//! docs/design/node.md §1.2; chunk-store.md §4).
//!
//! The issuer is one thread and a pool of blocking workers, all started when the device opens
//! and none after, whatever the number of volumes, batches or regions: a thread per region of a
//! batch, which mantle's chunk writer started before, is a thread start on the write path and a
//! count of threads that grows with load (mantle research/26 §4.7, recommendation 7). The pool is
//! the portable path of research/26 §2.5, the only one macOS offers: no interface there keeps
//! more than 16 file I/Os in flight without a blocked thread per I/O, and none carries
//! `F_FULLFSYNC` (§2.4). Linux's io_uring and Windows's completion port, which node.md §1.2 takes
//! where they exist, are not yet built; the pool runs on every platform until they are.
//!
//! The pool holds `min(device queue, measured depth, thread budget)` workers ([`depth`]): the
//! device queues no more than its queue, throughput stops growing at the measured depth, so a
//! transfer past it only waits, and every pool draws from the process's budget before any thread
//! starts (research/26 §2.5, recommendation 4). Where the budget has fewer left the device runs
//! at the depth it leaves.
//!
//! Ownership is single and passed by message. A submitter's file is duplicated once for each
//! worker ([`BlockFile::try_clone`]), and each worker owns its duplicates in an arena of its own,
//! so no file is shared between threads and nothing is locked. The issuer thread owns the
//! dispatch state; each worker owns one slot its tasks arrive on, woken alone (research/26 §5.3).
//! A worker is told of a file attached or detached in its own slot, before any transfer for it,
//! since a transfer goes only to a worker with no such news waiting. A volume's writer holds an
//! [`Attached`], through which it submits one batch at a time and waits for its answer. A
//! batch's writes all complete before its flush is issued, and the flush only if all succeeded:
//! a write that failed fails its batch, and its flush is never issued, because the caller then
//! fences and recovers rather than trust what reached the device (Rebello et al., ATC 2020). The
//! answer comes once, after the flush.
