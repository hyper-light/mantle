//!
//! Each field follows from the facts as `docs/durable.md` §6 states it: the segment from the
//! largest entry and the device's block, the file's segments from the disk budget, the groups from
//! the node's admission bound, a group's retention and recent bytes, and the queue from the groups.
//! The log's design is mantle's (`ORIGIN.md`), and the section of mantle's
//! `docs/design/raft-log.md` each rule follows is named beside it below. Facts that cannot hold one frame, or a budget under the log's
//! least file, are refused ([`Unfit`]), never clamped: a clamped configuration would run, and fail
//! later at a write the facts promised.
