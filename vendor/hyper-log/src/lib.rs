//! The shared Raft log (mantle docs/design/raft-log.md): one log per device, shared by every
//! group on it, so that one flush commits every group's writes.
//!
//! A replica submits its `Ready`'s entries, hard state, start and proposals as one [`Update`];
//! the writer gathers every update that arrived while the last flush ran into one frame, writes
//! and flushes it, publishes it to readers, and answers once a later durable record confirms the
//! flush. Reads serve the view a Raft core's storage needs: bounds, terms and entries.
//!
//! From mantle-log at mantle `147f035` (`ORIGIN.md`), with its state held by one owner instead of
//! a lock (mantle note 32 §3.9, L-2): callers reach the owner by message and hear back through
//! tickets, one to one (`ticket.rs`). The owner runs the writer as steps between messages on a
//! thread of its own and hands each I/O, with the device, to a caller of the frame that waits on
//! its answer, or else to the log's I/O thread, so the owner answers callers while a frame is
//! flushed, and a blocking write crosses from its caller to the owner and back, the caller doing
//! its frame's flush as mantle's writer did (`owner.rs`, `device.rs`). A log runs those two
//! threads, whatever its number of groups or callers. A group's replica reads its group through the group's handle ([`GroupLog`]), which
//! answers from the group's state as its writes left it, with no message to the owner
//! (`group.rs`).
