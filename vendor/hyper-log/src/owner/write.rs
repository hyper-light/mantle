//! The write path, mantle-log's writer loop as steps between messages (mantle
//! docs/design/raft-log.md §3, §5, §6).
//!
//! At the top of the loop the batch is what was held for this frame and what is queued. When
//! nothing is, the last frame is confirmed on its own, or the owner waits for a submission and
//! takes the first that comes. Under `Waits::Measured` it then waits for the submitters the last
//! frame answered (`hyper_block::commit`), and commits: a sweep of the tail is read on the device,
//! the batch is laid into a frame after the sweep's copies, and the frame is written and flushed
//! on the device; once it is, the frame is published, the frame before it answered, and the loop
//! goes round. Mantle's writer did each of these in turn on its own thread, blocking on the
//! device; here the owner hands each I/O to the device, done by a caller of the frame that waits
//! on its answer or by the log's I/O thread (`owner.rs`), and goes on answering callers until it
//! comes back, and the order of everything the log decides is the same. The device finishes a frame as the writer did after its flush
//! (`device.rs`): the frame before is answered, its confirmation being this frame's record, and
//! this frame confirmed on its own unless the owner has said another follows, which is when
//! submissions were admitted while the frame was on the device: what the writer found queued
//! when its flush returned.
