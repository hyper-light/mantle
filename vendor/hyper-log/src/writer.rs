//! The writer's rules (mantle docs/design/raft-log.md §3, §5): how a batch is ordered and laid
//! into a frame, where the frame goes, what a sweep of the tail copies, and what a durable frame
//! changes. The owner (`owner.rs`) runs them; they read and change the state it holds.
//!
//! It runs the chunk store's group-commit loop (chunk-store.md §4): it takes every update that
//! arrived while the last flush ran, lays them into one frame, writes the frame, flushes the
//! file once, and publishes the updates to readers. It answers them once a later durable record
//! confirms that flush: the next frame's persist record, or a confirmation written on its own when
//! no frame follows at once (raft-log.md §6). One frame is one batch, so a valid frame with a
//! later sequence proves an earlier one was flushed, which is what lets recovery tell a torn tail
//! from damage (§6).
//!
//! Segments are freed oldest first, so the live ones are always a run of incarnations that each
//! frame's tail names. A tail with no live piece left is freed at once. When updates are waiting
//! and free segments are short, the writer sweeps the tail: the frame first carries copies of
//! every live piece of the tail, and names the next segment as the tail, the cleaning of a
//! log-structured file system applied to the end of a log [RO92]. A group's live entries run
//! unbroken from its start to its last, and the pieces of a record die from its front by a start
//! and from its back by a replacement, so the live part of any record is one run and its copy is
//! no larger than the record. The copies of a whole tail therefore fit in one frame, and a sweep
//! always completes in the frame that begins it. A freed segment is reused only once a durable
//! frame names a tail past it; the last free segment is kept for a frame that does so, which is
//! how the log never runs out of room to free room.
