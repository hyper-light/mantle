//! What the core refuses, and why. Nothing here unwinds: what another core
//! asserts is an error of one of three kinds. A **refusal** changed nothing
//! and the caller may go on. A **violation** is a peer's message that
//! contradicts what this member holds; the message is dropped and nothing
//! changed. A **fatal** error means the member's own state no longer adds
//! up, or an operation stopped half way: the replica stops and is reopened
//! from its durable state.
