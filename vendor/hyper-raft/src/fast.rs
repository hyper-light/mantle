//! The fast track (Fast Raft: Castiglia, Goldberg and Patterson, ICDCS
//! 2020; 27 §4).
//!
//! A proposer sends its entry for an index to every voter and not to the
//! leader. A voter that holds nothing at the index holds the entry there,
//! **approved by itself**, and once that is durable tells the leader what it
//! holds: its vote. The leader decides each index in order. With the votes
//! of a classic quorum in, it takes the entry most voted for into its log;
//! with a fast quorum holding that entry, the index is committed without
//! another round.
//!
//! What a member approved by itself is kept here, beside the log and never
//! in it: the log holds what a leader approved and nothing else, so the
//! log is the classic one and elections compare it as they always did. A
//! member keeps what it holds after its log reaches the index, until it
//! knows the index committed by a classic quorum: an election counts what
//! members hold, and a log that reached the index can be cut back short of
//! it ([`crate::track`], `docs/raft.md` §3.5). Because elections compare
//! logs, what a member holds counts for a fast commit only once its log
//! holds an entry of the committing leader's term: the log must then say
//! the member took that leader's word.
//!
//! A leader stamps what it takes with its own term. The term a proposer
//! gave says nothing of the entry, for two proposers of one term propose
//! different entries for one index, and an index and a term name one entry
//! of the log only while one member alone writes each term.
