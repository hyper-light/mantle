//! A **classic** quorum is a majority: any two intersect, which is what

//! ⌈3M/4⌉ (Fast Raft, Castiglia, Goldberg and Patterson, ICDCS 2020): any
//! two fast quorums intersect in more than half of the members, and a fast
//! quorum and a classic one intersect in more than half of the classic
//! one, so an entry a fast quorum chose is the most voted in every classic
//! quorum a later leader gathers.
//!
//! During a joint configuration a decision needs the quorum of **both**
//! voter sets (Ongaro's thesis §4.3).
