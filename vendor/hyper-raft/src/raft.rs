//! The member: what it does with time and with messages.
//!
//! This is Raft as Ongaro's thesis states it and as `raft-rs` runs it, which
//! is what focal's groups ran on before: on one schedule the two say the
//! same, message for message. Where they differ it is by decision, and each
//! place says so:
//!
//! - nothing unwinds; what is asserted there is an [`Error`] here;
//! - a leader that is no voter any more steps down, and hands the lead to a
//!   voter that holds the whole log, where `raft-rs` leaves it leading a
//!   group it is no member of;
//! - priority orders elections and never judges the vote a transfer asks
//!   for, and it is not in force while the member has no term;
//! - a member told to campaign while a change it has committed is not yet
//!   applied campaigns once it is, where `raft-rs` forgets that it was told;
//! - what is queued has a bound ([`Limits`]).
