//! This core and `raft-rs` on one schedule (27 §6, stage D): the same
//! members, the same messages delivered, lost, repeated and held back in
//! the same order, the same stops and compactions. After every step both
//! say what they persisted, sent, committed and answered, and what each
//! member knows of the others; all of it is equal, or the run fails naming
//! its seed and its step.
//!
//! The two differ by decision in two places a schedule reaches. A leader
//! that applies a change which leaves it no voter steps down here and
//! leads on there: a run that comes to it ends there, and what this core
//! does from there on is tested by itself (`group.rs`). A member told by
//! its leader to campaign while it asks whether it could be elected
//! campaigns here and ignores it there, where the leader then waits an
//! election timeout for nothing: the schedule loses that message for both,
//! and the run goes on.
