# hyper-rt: where it comes from

slates' runtime, taken at slates `6b9ce5c` (2026-10-05) and designed onward for all three consumers
(docs/runtime.md). slates was not changed; it moves onto this crate on its own schedule.

## What was taken

| Here | From slates | What changed in the port |
|---|---|---|
| `src/*.rs` (runtime, shard, registry, parking, task, queue, timer, driver, kqueue, epoll, iocp, afd, netsys, udp, tcp, readiness, futures, sim, attribution, thread_clock, waker, control, error) | `crates/rt/src` | Paths renamed (`slates_mem` → `crate::mem`, `slates_machine` → `crate::machine`). `uring.rs` not taken: its io_uring driver runs in readiness mode only, a second path to epoll (docs/runtime.md §3.7). `RuntimeConfig::from_profile` became `from_calibration` (below). `UdpSocket::dont_fragment` added, so the don't-fragment tests read the option through the crate instead of an `unsafe` call of their own. |
| `src/mem/{error,handle,loom_bounds,mpsc,ring,segmented,slab}.rs` | `crates/mem/src` | Only what the runtime uses. The arenas, the buddy allocator, budgets, locked and shared regions and pre-faulting are slates' storage, not a runtime, and are not taken: the runtime locks and pre-faults nothing. |
| `src/machine/{bench,clock,derived,error,facts,placement,stats,wake}.rs` | `crates/machine/src` | `serde` derives and the JSON profile removed; the BLAKE3 identity hash removed (a consumer keys its stored calibration as it chooses, docs/runtime.md §10.2). `Placement::of` takes the consumer's reserved cores in place of slates' fixed one for control and the OS (§10.3); the wake probe's waker runs on the first reserved core, or a sibling shard's when none is reserved. |
| `src/machine/probes.rs` | `crates/machine/src/probes.rs` | Only the system-call probe and thread pinning. The fault, memcpy, hash, codec, lock-capacity and core-matrix probes size slates' storage and are not taken. |
| `src/machine/calibration.rs` | new, in place of slates' `profile.rs` | The three measurements the runtime needs and the constants derived from them under the consumer's policy (docs/runtime.md §10). |
| `tests/*.rs` | `crates/rt/tests` | Paths renamed. `timer_allocations.rs` counts through hyper-measure's counting allocator; slates' own check that its allocator does not attribute another thread's allocations is hyper-measure's to test, and is not carried. The `rt_bench` example and the callgrind bench are not taken; docs/runtime.md §12's benchmarks replace them. |

## The suite at the port

`cargo test -p hyper-rt` on macOS arm64, Rust 1.98.0, before any of docs/runtime.md's departures:
91 unit tests, 70 integration tests in 22 files, 6 doctests, all passing. The departures are made
against this suite.

| `src/udp/linux.rs`, `src/udp/macos.rs`, `src/udp/batched.rs` | hyper-tokio `src/sys/{linux,macos}.rs`, `src/socket.rs`, `src/clock.rs` | The batched calls and kernel stamps, moved so hyper-tokio and hyper-rt share one layer (docs/runtime.md §5.1, §14). `Batched` awaits hyper-rt's readiness instead of tokio's reactor, so a receive always asks the kernel (no `Through::Reactor`). Stamps land on the shard's clock by their age; macOS reads the age on `mach_absolute_time` (`Clock::now_ticks`). Astray reports are a seam outcome; EIO from a segmented send resends unsegmented instead of dropping. |

## Current development overlay

The consumer currently imports the local `hyper-rt-service-root` candidate; its exact
Rust source/test censuses are recorded in `vendor/UPSTREAM.md`, not an accepted producer
commit. The overlay adds cooperative service admission and cancellation ownership,
nonblocking manual-step/readiness progression, typed driver-loss cleanup, context checks
before each synchronization receive poll, checked channel slot/ticket layouts before
construction, and cold Runtime-owned bounded native retirement groups. TCP serving
metadata is owned from the first shard claim, and accept futures retain guards across
refused admission and cancellation; partial setup and dropped acceptors release their
metadata before a same-capacity healthy server retry. Native handles are adopted before
engines enter a shard; an actor
awaits the actual join receipt, including native TLS destruction, without joining inline.
Runtime shutdown retains those retirement owners until all service shard workers finish.
Original files transfer to the same native reaper before service admission. Their separate
lease answers only after worker joins, the registered physical attachment fence, and final
file close. Cancellation retains this ownership and a known physical error precedes later
join/destructor failures. Actors retain receipts rather than native file owners.
The cold synchronous APIs remain distinct; their entered-shard calls are refused before
blocking admission. These source identities do not establish a performance or universal
foreign-destructor guarantee. The pending generic canceled-grant handoff proposal is not
part of this imported tree. Producer and consumer gates and all six native targets still
require exact final-tree acceptance.
