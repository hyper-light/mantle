//! `hyper-rt` — the shared runtime (docs/runtime.md), ported from slates' `rt` (ORIGIN.md): a thread-per-core executor with arena task slots and `Copy` waker
//! encodings, an intrusive run queue, a hierarchical timing wheel, per-shard inbound rings with
//! cross-shard wake kicks, the OS drivers behind one completion seam, and a deterministic
//! simulation driver (design §4.3, D-7, D-9).
//!
//! The doctrine, in one paragraph. A task belongs to one shard for its whole life; nothing is
//! work-stolen and nothing is reference counted. A `Waker` is a `RawWaker` whose data pointer is
//! the packed `shard:16 | slot:24 | generation:24` word of the task's handle, so `clone` and
//! `drop` are no-ops and `wake` from the owning shard pushes the slot onto the local run queue,
//! `wake` from another shard pushes the word onto that pair's single-producer ring and kicks the
//! target's driver, and `wake` from a foreign thread goes through the target's multi-producer ring
//! (embassy-executor's model on std [C: embassy-executor src/raw; B: `RawWakerVTable` docs]). A
//! stale generation is ignored. Timers live in a hierarchical timing wheel [A: Varghese & Lauck,
//! SOSP'87] whose tick is derived from the measured wake cost. Every operation is cancel-safe by
//! construction: resources live in arenas keyed by handle, so dropping a future releases nothing
//! it did not own; a parent's completion cancels and joins its children (hecate's task-lifecycle
//! law). The drivers (epoll, kqueue, IOCP) share one seam: block until a kick, a
//! completion or a deadline; the simulation driver replaces time and the kick with seeded,
//! single-threaded stand-ins so a whole cluster runs deterministically in one process (D-20).
//!
//! `LocalWaker` is still a nightly-only API on Rust 1.98 (`local_waker`, #118959), so the
//! executor uses `Waker` with a vtable that is thread-safe by construction; the `Copy` encoding
//! costs nothing to clone, which is what `LocalWaker` would have saved (Phase 0 task 6).
//!
//! Modules: [`error`], [`control`], [`waker`], [`registry`], [`parking`] (the kick-if-parked
//! protocol and its loom model), [`task`], [`queue`], [`timer`], [`driver`], [`sim`], [`shard`],
//! [`runtime`], [`futures`], `attribution` (who held a long poll: the task or the host), the async
//! sockets ([`udp`] and [`tcp`] on every OS, over one shared readiness future), and the OS drivers.

// Test code opts out of the no-panic wall at the crate root (CLAUDE.md §1); shipped code does not.
