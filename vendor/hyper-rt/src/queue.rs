//! The local run queue: a ring of ready slot indices with one pending flag per slot, so a task woken
//! many times between polls appears once and the ring never holds more than the arena's slots (slates'
//! `queue.rs`; §4.3 "intrusive run queue"; no allocation on the wake path).
//!
//! Single-threaded by construction: only the owning shard's thread pushes and pops. The ring is a
//! [`CellRing`] (docs/runtime.md §3.4), so nothing is borrowed and nothing is refused: slates' version
//! kept its lists in `RefCell`s and counted the re-entrant accesses it refused.
//!
//! A step takes at most its poll budget, oldest first. Wakes that arrive while the phase runs join the
//! same FIFO behind tasks already ready and may use its remaining budget. A task that wakes itself while it
//! is polled — a yield — waits apart (`push_deferred`) and rejoins the FIFO behind everything ready, once
//! what was ready has run or at the next step after the wakes from other threads (mantle
//! `docs/design/event-loop.md` D7). A pending flag covers both rings, so a slot is in at most one, once.
//! `batch` can still capture the number ready now for callers that need a fixed snapshot.
