//! The process-wide shard registry: how a wake finds its target (slates §4.3; docs/runtime.md §3.2).
//!
//! Each shard registers into one of [`MAX_SHARDS`] **slots** and gives it back when its runtime shuts
//! down: a slot holds the shard's wake bitmap (for wakes from other threads), the sending end of its
//! control channel, its kick, its parking word and its pulse, plus a `generation` word that is **even
//! while live and odd while free**. The slot's memory is process-static and never freed, so a waker that
//! outlives its shard reads a live-or-free word, never freed memory: a wake to a free slot is dropped and
//! counted, and one to a slot a later shard reused wakes a task of that shard spuriously at most, which
//! every future tolerates. The kick descriptor is owned by the slot and closed at unregistration.
//!
//! Registration takes the lowest free slot under one atomic exchange on the slot's generation
//! (free → claimed), so concurrent runtimes never share a slot; lookup is one `Acquire` load of the
//! generation and a parity check.
//!
//! Routing: on the owning shard's thread, inside a step, a wake goes straight to the desk's run queue;
//! from anywhere else it sets the task's bit in the target's wake bitmap and kicks the target only if it
//! is parked. No wake ever waits: the bitmap holds every slot (slates' rings made a sender spin while a
//! ring was full).
