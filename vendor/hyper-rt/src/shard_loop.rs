//! The shard's loop: one thread, one task table, one run queue, one timing wheel, one driver, and the
//! loop that ties them (slates §4.3, "Loop"; docs/runtime.md §3.4).
//!
//! Each step: drain the control channel and the wake bitmap (spawns, cancels, shutdown, wakes from other
//! threads) and the driver's completions into the run queue; expire timers; poll ready tasks, at most a
//! batch of them, applying what each poll asked of the desk before the next; then, if nothing is ready,
//! spin out the idle window that client activity opened, and park in the driver until a kick, a completion
//! or the next deadline. Cancellation guarantees a terminal completion: the future is dropped at the next
//! poll boundary, the task's children are cancelled and joined, and whoever joins it sees `Cancelled`.
//! A step's polls fill its step budget at the cost the shard measured its last step's polls (`next_batch`).
//! The watchdog times each step that polled, from its start to its polls' end, and attributes a step past
//! its budget and one quantum to its tasks or to the host ([`crate::attribution`]).
//!
//! **Ownership.** [`Shard`] owns everything here by value: its desk (boxed, so the address the thread's
//! current-shard pointer names is stable) and its loop state. A step lends the desk to the tasks it polls
//! and keeps the loop state to itself; between polls it applies the desk's intents. There is no `unsafe`,
//! no `RefCell` and nothing a nested call could find borrowed.
