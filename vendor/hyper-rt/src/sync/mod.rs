//! Synchronization between tasks and threads (docs/runtime.md §8): a bounded channel, a one-shot, a watched
//! word, a semaphore and a notification, each usable between any two of a task on the same shard, a task on
//! another shard, and a plain thread. One mechanism per primitive, never a local and a remote variant.
//!
//! **What the ends share** is a [`cell`]: a few atomic words in a process-wide generational table (the
//! waiter's word, a state word, a version), freed by the last handle. **What crosses** is moved, never
//! shared: a value travels through a [`ring`], bounded at the primitive's capacity, in a block the ends
//! share for as long as the cell's handles live (`ring::Shared`). No path takes a lock: the values used to
//! travel through `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel`, whose blocked receivers and notifying senders meet in a
//! pthread mutex (mantle `docs/design/event-loop.md` D4).
//!
//! **Waiting.** A waiter, a task or a plain thread blocked in a call, registers itself in the cell and
//! checks again before it waits; a sender publishes, then wakes the registered waiter. The order (publish
//! then wake, register then check), with a fence on each side, means no wake is lost: a sender that published
//! before the register is seen by the check, and one that published after finds the waiter
//! (`crate::handoff`). A thread waits parked, and the publisher that takes it unparks it: one wake a
//! registration, however many publish.
//!
//! **No broadcast.** A wake reaches one waiter (docs/runtime.md §8; mantle note 26 §5): a watched word's
//! receivers each have their own cell, which the sender wakes one by one, at most the configured receivers.
