//! A bounded ring of values with no lock on any path, and the block a primitive's ends share it through
//! (docs/runtime.md §8; mantle `docs/design/event-loop.md` D4). The synchronization primitives carried their
//! values through `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel`, whose blocking receive and send register in a waiter
//! list behind a pthread mutex (std `sync/mpmc/waker.rs`, `SyncWaker`): mantle's fill profile caught threads
//! in `__psynch_mutexwait` under `SyncWaker::register` while senders held it to notify
//! (`benchmark-results/mantle-boxed-request-ab-20261010/fill5m-sample.txt`). Here the ring is only atomics
//! and the slots' values, and waiting is the cell's waiter word (`crate::handoff`), so neither end ever
//! waits for the other to leave a critical section.
//!
//! **The ring** is Vyukov's bounded queue [C: Dmitry Vyukov, "Bounded MPMC queue", 1024cores.net]: each
//! slot carries a stamp, the position it is free for (`position`) or full at (`position + 1`); a producer
//! claims a position by compare-and-swap on the tail and publishes by storing the stamp, a consumer claims by
//! compare-and-swap on the head and releases the slot for the next lap by storing `position + lap`. A
//! position is a lap above an index (`lap | index`), one lap the capacity rounded up to a power of two and at
//! least two, as Rust's std encodes its array channel (`sync/mpmc/array.rs`), so the capacity is exact and
//! "full at this lap" never reads as "free for the next" (slates' word ring refused a capacity of one for
//! exactly that collision, AUD-29-33).
//!
//! **No spin.** A slot the consumer has claimed but not yet released reads as full, and a position a
//! producer has claimed but not yet published reads as empty: the call returns at once and the waiter
//! protocol carries progress (the consumer grants room after it releases; a producer wakes the consumer
//! after it publishes). Neither end waits on a peer that the scheduler has preempted mid-operation, which a
//! spin on those two states would do. A compare-and-swap retries only after another end's claim of the same
//! position succeeded, and a view of the tail or the head left behind advances past positions others
//! completed or reads the latest value by a read-modify-write once, so every retry follows another end's
//! progress (lock-free). A view that still makes no sense after that read, a slot's stamp laps older than the
//! latest tail or head, is reported full or empty rather than read again until it changes: nothing bounds how
//! long a plain load may return an old value (loom explores exactly that, and a loop on it never ended), while
//! the waiting protocols fence before their second look, which rules such a stamp out.
//!
//! **The shared block** ([`Shared`]) is the state a primitive's ends share, freed by the last end: its count
//! is the primitive's cell's handle count (`crate::sync::cell`), so the block lives exactly as long as the
//! cell's handles, the existing ownership of every primitive here, and nothing is reference counted twice.
