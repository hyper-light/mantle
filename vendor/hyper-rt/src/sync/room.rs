//! The senders a bounded channel holds waiting for room (docs/runtime.md §8; mantle
//! `docs/design/event-loop.md` D4): one slot each, at most the channel's `waiters`, with no lock on any path.
//!
//! **A slot per waiting sender, freed in place.** A sender that finds the channel full takes a free slot
//! (compare-and-swap, free → waiting) and waits in it: a task registers its word in the slot's waiter word,
//! a plain thread parks with its handle registered there (`crate::handoff`). A sender that stops waiting
//! without a grant (its own retry found room, or its future was dropped) frees its slot on the spot, so the
//! bound is exactly the senders waiting now. The queue this replaces kept a sender's entry until the
//! receiver's grants walked past it, so entries no one waited on held places, and a full queue refused live
//! senders.
//!
//! **Grants go round the slots.** Whoever makes room (the receiver after each take, a sender handing on
//! room it was granted and did not use) grants one waiting slot (waiting → granted) and wakes its waiter.
//! The search starts after the last slot granted, so a waiting sender is passed over at most once a round:
//! every waiter is granted within `waiters` grants of its slot being seen.
//!
//! **No lost room.** The waiter takes its slot, then checks the channel again; the receiver frees a value's
//! slot, then looks at the waiters. Each side writes, then reads what the other wrote, the store-buffering
//! shape, so each puts a `SeqCst` fence between its write and its read (as [`crate::handoff`] and
//! [`crate::parking`] do): whichever fence comes first, the side after it sees the other's write, so either
//! the sender's check finds the room or the grant finds the sender. A waiter counts itself in `waiting`
//! before its fence, so the receiver reads one word after its fence while no one waits.
//!
//! **A grant not seen is handed on.** A grant can reach a place whose sender has just sent on room made
//! earlier; a sender letting its place go hands on any grant it did not see before it sent ([`Room::leave`]).
